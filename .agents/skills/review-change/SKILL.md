description: Fresh-context review and PR hand-off for an ibcmd-rs change. Runs an independent critic over the diff, resolves its findings, then opens or updates the PR with What, Why and Evidence and moves the board card. Use when a change is ready for a PR, before a draft is marked ready, or when asked to review a branch.

# Review a change and hand it off

## 1. Preconditions

`cargo xtask ci` passed, or its failures are proven pre-existing (skill
`verify-change`). The issue and its acceptance criteria are at hand.

## 2. Read your diff as a stranger

```text
git diff "$(git merge-base HEAD origin/master)"...HEAD
```

Remove debug output, commented-out code, drive-by edits unrelated to the
issue, and comments that narrate the change or mention this session. Comments
explain why the code is the way it is, nothing else.

## 3. Independent review

Hand the reviewer the issue, the base revision and your evidence, nothing
more: no suspicions, no hints about what is right.

- Claude Code: the `critic` subagent.
- Other agents: a new session given the instructions in
  `.claude/agents/critic.md` (the text after its front matter).

On `REQUEST_CHANGES`, fix, re-verify and send the result back to the same
reviewer so it keeps its context. Answer a finding you disagree with by
evidence, never by silence. Repeat until `APPROVE`.

## 4. The PR

Branch `agent/issue-<N>-<slug>`; title `type(scope): summary`. Body:

```markdown
## What
<the change in a few sentences>

## Why
<the problem, with the issue>

## Evidence
<commands and results, measurements, pre-existing failures with their
merge-base reproduction, steps not run locally>

AI: <tool and model>, <what it did>.

Closes #N
```

Use `Refs #N` instead of `Closes` when acceptance stays open. Create it as a
draft (`gh pr create --draft --base master --body-file <file>`) and mark it
ready only after `ci` passes and the critic approves.

## 5. The board

Move the issue to In review and read the value back (AGENTS.md, Tracking).

## 6. Rules you missed

If you hit a trap AGENTS.md does not mention, propose the rule under
"Suggested AGENTS.md changes" in the PR body. A rule earns its place when it
is non-obvious, keeps recurring and is specific enough to act on.

## 7. Clean up

Scratch infobases, native exports and corpus outputs go as soon as their
run is reported. When the PR is merged or you leave the worktree, run
`cargo clean` in it, or `git worktree remove` it. Leave a target directory
alone while another cargo process uses it. Say in your final report what you
removed and what you kept, and why.
